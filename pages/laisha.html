  <h1>Laisha's Playlists</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    Hi laisha! I was gonna write the link to the playlist on the postcard but that would take forever for me to write and then you to type in. So then I thought, hmm, maybe ill use a URL shortener but I think you have to pay for those so they actually last. There's free ones but i think they expire after a wire like QR codes so i didn't want to take the chance. Because if it didnt work:<br><br>

    1. Maybe you'd think I was trying to get you to reach out and be like hey the link didnt work <br>
    2. Embarassingggggg<br><br>

    So I figured why not make things easier and just make a whole website.
    
    anyway, check back for more playlists to be added!
