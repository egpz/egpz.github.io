  <h1>Laisha's Playlists</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    Hi laisha! I was gonna write the link to the playlist on the postcard but that would take forever for me to write and then you to type in. So then I thought, hmm, maybe ill use a URL shortener but I think you have to pay for those so they actually last. There's free ones but i think they expire after a while like QR codes so i didn't want to take the chance. Because if it didnt work:<br><br>

    1. Maybe you'd think I was trying to get you to reach out and be like hey the link didnt work <br>
    2. Embarassingggggg<br><br>

    So I figured why not make things easier and just make a whole website.
    
    anyway, check back for more playlists to be added!

    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="intro">
    These playlists are arranged intentionally so you can play them in order. Kinda like a vinyl record. (Shoutout Camelot Wheel)
    Of course you can play it on shuffle or only the songs you like but at least for the first listen through, you can just hit play.
    with that said, the playlist is better if you put like 4/5 sec crossfade.
    <br><br>
    I thought about the name of this one for a while, it started as "Laisha - Happy" then went through a few versions. 
    I try to keep these to around an hour to be consice and also so it is listenable like a record. I'm happy with the end product.
    I hope you like it :)
